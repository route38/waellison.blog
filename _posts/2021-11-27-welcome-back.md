Welcome to my blog, and thank you for visiting.  This is not my first foray
into the blogosphere, but it has been a while since I've maintained a regular
Web presence.  I'm looking forward to getting back into the practice of
maintaining a blog and talking about things I'm making.

## Who I Am

My name is William Ellison.  I am a Python developer living in Knoxville,
Tennessee, who is currently seeking employment as a programmer.  Since 2018,
I have been working in the healthcare industry as a billing representative
and, latterly, in accounts receivable.  I have recently completed the
_Backend Development with Python, SQL, and DevOps_ course at Nucamp, an
online coding boot camp based in Bellevue, Washington.

My technical background also includes a bachelor's degree earned at the
University of Tennessee in 2011, which was in computer science.  In addition
to my Python skills, I can program in Ruby, C++, C, and JavaScript.

## What This Site Is

Here are some of the topics you'll find here at _Route 38_ in the coming
months.

* Python, Flask, and Django
* JavaScript and ReactJS
* C, Ada, and Unix
* Microsoft Azure
* HTML &amp; CSS
* Jekyll
* Docker &amp; Kubernetes
* macOS
* Linux
* Apache
* PostgreSQL
* Git and GitHub
* CI/CD
* Server Hardware

I have a lot of interests to cover here and I expect that there will be a lot
of posts on each one -- learning things awakens the desire inside me to
document the process.  Note that, obviously, not all of these have equal
weight: I'm not going to be blogging about C, Ada, or Unix programming nearly
as much as about Python or Azure.

## What This Site Is Not

I am a highly opinionated person, and this site might develop some soapbox-like
traits at various points -- but this is not meant to be a soapbox.

This site is not a discussion forum.  I have never had comments enabled on my
blogs and I have no plans to start now -- so, don't ask.  You can engage me via
email or on LinkedIn and I'll be happy to address you -- if you are respectful,
thoughtful, and apposite in what you have to offer.  If you solely exist to
flame or troll, I'm going to ignore you.

## Onward toward the future

I'll see you good people back here the next time I upload a post.  I'm anxious
to see what comes of this experiment with the medium of blogging, and how far I
can take _Route 38_ this time.

Be excellent to each other.
