Or: "I Survived Your Crappy Candidate Experience and Didn't Even Get a
Lousy T-Shirt."<br><br>The year is 2011, and I‚Äôm getting ready to graduate
college.  As such, I‚Äôve got more than my fair share of interviews either
lined up, in-progress, or completed.  An opportunity evinced itself
through a campus job fair, and I was excited since it seemed like a good
fit.

The opportunity is with a government contractor in southwest Virginia,
and it takes an hour and a half to drive there from Knoxville, a drive I
have to start making at 6:00am in order to get to the interview site at
a reasonable time.  This means I‚Äôm going to be missing at least one
lecture, and I‚Äôm not happy about it, even if it means having a chance to
prove myself in an interview.

I wasn‚Äôt a morning person at the time, and up to that time, the 75-mile
drive was my longest solo trip away from home.

When I arrive, I sign in at the front desk and one red flag is already
waving back at me: I‚Äôm not the only interviewee here -- and, I recognize
the other guy there because he‚Äôs in the same degree program, at the same
university, as I am.

Perhaps they recognized a red flag in me: the dress code for the
interview was specified to be business formal, but at the time I didn‚Äôt
own a business suit.  Shocking, I know, but I had never needed a suit
before, and I didn‚Äôt have the time or the money to buy one before the
interview.  So, I came up in khakis, a dress shirt, and a necktie, plus
my wingtip shoes and my leather attache.  (I ended up buying a suit.
Navy blue with pinstripes.  Once I had the jacket taken in a bit, dare I
say I looked pretty sharp in it.  I gave it away once I lost weight.
Then I gained the weight back and then some.  Different story for
another time.)

The person overseeing the process (HR I guess?) comes out and announces
that the big event schedule they had planned has been canceled, and
they‚Äôre just going to put each of us in a room and give us a series of
interviews.  (I‚Äôd almost guarantee, upon reflection, that this was a
setup to see how we reacted to stress.  I was just disappointed since I
was hoping for a free lunch and a tour of the office, but I got neither
of those things.  It was just as well: the town where I interviewed had
like three fast-food joints and the office was a ghost town.  The firm
did, however, pay me $150 for mileage, gas at the Sunoco station in
Bristol, and lunch at the McDonald‚Äôs in Dandridge, just off I-81, on my
way back to the Scruffy City.  Employers, take note: comp your
interviewees for taking time off work and putting miles on their cars to
come talk to you.  Cutting me that check was a true alpha move on their
part.)

I remember one of my six (!) interviewers well: he was in his
mid-thirties, so probably he has 10-15 years on me, and he took a
dislike to me almost immediately.  He asked me about my development
environment and looked disgusted when I explained that I worked
exclusively under the Linux operating system at the time, as required by
my degree program.  He expressed disbelief when I told him that I used
the Emacs editor for my code, and I swear I think he thought I was
making stuff up -- he wrote down ‚ÄúEmax‚Äù instead of the proper Emacs, and
I‚Äôm sure he was expecting me to give the name of some crappy, bloated
development environment like Visual Studio or Eclipse (and yes,
children, even today the big, bloated development environments run
counter to everything I hold dear).  He didn‚Äôt think highly of my chosen
hobbies of Web development and video games.  And when I explained that I
didn‚Äôt have any side projects (because I was a student, I had course
projects but little time for my own code), but offered to talk about
some of my coursework, my offer was rebuffed (apparently writing your
own malloc(3) implementation, a threaded chat server, or a
general-purpose 3D renderer aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsignificant enough‚Äù because I did
them for a grade!).  Another interviewer pressed me on minutiae of C++
that I hadn‚Äôt seen or thought about in years (things like templates,
multiple inheritance, operator overloading, etc.), all because I put C++
on my resume (and despite my disclaiming myself by saying that of late,
I had mostly been working in C and Java).

What you see is what you get, folks.  I hide little, sugarcoat nothing,
and I‚Äôm unapologetically me, down to the very finest detail.  That will
never change.  Neither will my love of Emacs -- it was the second
program I installed on my MacBook Pro when I bought that laptop earlier
this year.  GNU Emacs may be Generally Not Used Except by Middle-Aged
Computer Scientists (and me, apparently, though I‚Äôm well on my way to
being a middle-aged computer scientist!), but I have a lot of happy
memories of using Emacs and writing my best code in it.

Takeaways:

üö© Multiple interviewees at once is worse than multiple interviewers at
once, but this is like saying that a gunshot to the shin is worse than
one to the foot.

üö© Shuffling people into and out of the interview room (or, worse,
shuffling *me* from room to room) is nerve-wracking, especially for
those of us with social anxiety.  If that‚Äôs how the interview process is
going to be, I need to know that ahead of time so I can mentally prepare
myself (by bowing out of the process, most likely).
