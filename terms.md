## Disclaimers

The content presented here does not represent the position, strategies, or opinions of my employer(s).  Additionally, my thoughts, opinions, and beliefs change from time to time, which is a necessary consequence of having an open mind.  Accordingly, this website is intended to provide a transparent, semi-permanent snapshot and manifestation of the various ideas within my mind.  As such, thoughts and opinions expressed in outdated posts may not be the same as, or even similar to, views that I hold today.

## Linking Policy

If you wish to link to an article from this site, please use the permalink given at the bottom of the post itself, and be sure to use HTTPS in your link.  The `www` subdomain is optional when referencing the site's domain, but I prefer _not_ to use it.  I'd prefer if you used the title of the post in your link, but this is not required.

## Email and Social Media Policy

Please send email to <waellison@gmail.com> if you wish to get in touch.  If you send a message, please be sure to:

1. State your name or desired pseudonym.
2. Ask your question(s) clearly and concisely.
3. Write in English or French.

I'll do my best to respond to your query within 48 hours.  You can also send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn if that's more your style; I am [@waedotpy](https://twitter.com/waedotpy) on Twitter and [/in/tnwae](https://linkedin.com/in/tnwae) on LinkedIn.

I do not respond to marketing emails.  If you try to sell me something in an email or DM, then I will consider it as spam and I will not answer it.

If you send me an email or a social media post, you agree that you surrender irrevocably all rights to the content of the message and further agree that I may post the content of such mail, with identifying information redacted, to this site for the purpose of commentary and criticism.

## Privacy Policy

I do not, as a matter of operations, collect identifying information from you simply by your visiting this website.  Out of respect for your privacy, I do not set cookies, I do not use external dependencies (aside from Google Web Fonts), and I do not use analytics software.

If you send me an email with personally identifying information, or a social media message, I will redact all potentially personalizing information from it unless such information is part of the metadata of the post (e.g. a Tweet or a LinkedIn update).

## Sponsored Content

I don't write it.

Products and services that I review at this site are purchased with my own funds.  I do not accept free products or services in exchange for reviews and this site will never host sponsored content.  If you wish to send me an example of your product, or provide me with a complimentary membership to your service, please move along as I will not accept your promotional offer (and even if you assert otherwise, it is a promotional offer).
